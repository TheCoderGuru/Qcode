### What I learned

From this project, I understood practically the use of width and how important and how it made my work easier and faster.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
 .content{
        left: 130px;
        width: 50%;
    }

```


### Continued development

I will like to explore works that will improve my centralizing skills.
